        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A cute picture of a fictional trash collecting robot. When thinking of a character to use,
            somehow this was the first thing that appeared. A character from a very good movie that I cried over
            when I was a kid. The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E">WALL-E</a>
            holds very important themes of sustainability and physical health, and he is adorable.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="color">He is a cute robot, and honestly it was fun to do this project while remembering how much I love it as a kid</li>
            <li>Reminds me how important nature conservation is and also how important physical health is</li>
            <li>When he was getting crushed by the platform, I was crying</li>
        </ul>
